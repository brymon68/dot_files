- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Github

Your primary method for interacting with Github should be through the Github CLI.

## PR Comments

<pr-comment-rule>
When I say to add a comment to a PR with a TODO on it, use  'checkbox'm mardkdown format to add the TODO. For instance:

<example>
- [ ] A descrition of the TODO item.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for thes sake of concision.

## Typescript preferences

- Never use the `any` type. Prefer `unknown` if you must use a top type.
